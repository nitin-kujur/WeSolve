						<li>
						<p class="font_8">In the course of using the Platform (whether as a Company &nbsp;or Company), we may ask you to provide us with, or grant us access to, or permission to obtain, certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you; personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, your name, company name, email address, postal address, work experience and interests, and phone number (”Information“).</p>

We may request documents to verify this information, such as a copy of your government-issued identification or photo, and we may authenticate it against third party databases or request a credit report.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p class="font_8">As further described in our Terms of Service, you may register or input data onto our Platform directly via the Site or by logging into your account with certain third party social networking services (including, but not limited to, LinkedIn or Facebook) (“SNS”) via our Site. If you choose to input data via an SNS, we will use the Personal Information you have provided to the SNS (such as your ”real” name, email address, gender, prior experience and other information you make publicly available via the SNS) to modify and update your account; the information we extract may depend on the privacy settings you have with the SNS. Other than what we may share with the SNS as described below, the Personal Information an SNS has about you is obtained by the SNS independent of our Platform, and WeSolv is not responsible for its accuracy, legality, or non-infringement.</p>
						</li>

						<p class="font_8">You may link your WeSolv account to your SNS account, in which case the SNS may share certain information about you with other SNS users, as well as sharing certain information about other SNS users with you. You represent that you are authorized to use your SNS account for the purposes described herein without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern the SNS, and without obligating WeSolv to pay any fees or making WeSolv subject to any usage limitations imposed by such SNS.
