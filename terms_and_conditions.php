					<p class="font_8"><b>1. THE WESOLV PLATFORM.</b></p>

					<!-- <p class="font_8">&nbsp;</p> -->

					<p class="font_8"><b>1.1 Purpose of the WeSolv Platform.</b></p>

					<!-- <p class="font_8">&nbsp;</p> -->

					<p class="font_8">The WeSolv Platform has been created to offer a number of online and offline services to users requesting services to be performed (each, and you in such capacity, an “Enterprise Company” or “Company, and such services, the “Services”) and students pursuing or individuals having obtained the conditions required by the site (each, and you in such capacity, a “Student”). Under this Agreement, WeSolv provides services to you in your capacity as either a Company or Student. For clarity, the term “you”, as used in this Agreement, may mean “Company” and/or “Student”. Our services include curating a network of Companies and Students, supporting the formation of case competitions, matching and connecting of Companies and Students and sometimes facilitating the disbursement of Company issued prizes or awards. Companies request the posting of Enterprise Challenges and invite Students to apply. Students, in turn, sign up and apply to work on Enterprise Challenges according to individual rules. If Student applies to Enterprise Challenge, he or she agrees to all stated terms. WeSolv collects payment from Companies in connection with posting challenge on the WeSolv platform and certain access to Students and appropriate information. WeSolv then facilitates disbursement of prizes/awards according to Enterprise Challenge outcomes and terms to appropriate students. &nbsp;</p>

					<!-- <p class="font_8">&nbsp;</p> -->

					<p class="font_8">WeSolv charges both Students and Companies a fee for the services of connecting the two parties and for collecting the fixed fee agreed between a Company and a Student for work prior to the commencement of a Services Contract (“Student Fee”).

					<p class="font_8">WeSolv will automatically disburse funds to Students according to the payment instructions on file with WeSolv within one (1) month after funds become payable.

WeSolv reserves the right to refuse any such request and may assess a processing fee in connection with such a request.</p>

					<!-- <p class="font_8">&nbsp;</p> -->

					<p class="font_8"><b>3.3 Payment.</b></p>

					<!-- <p class="font_8">&nbsp;</p> -->

To the extent that WeSolv is obligated to collect such taxes, the applicable tax will be added to your billing account. All sales are final. WeSolv is not responsible for any costs or expenses in connection with any interactions between Students and Businesses.</p>

					<!-- <p class="font_8">&nbsp;</p> -->

					<p class="font_8">Company will make all payments relating to, or in any way connected with, an Enterprise Challenge via negotiated WeSolv terms. Any action that encourages or solicits complete or partial payment outside of the WeSolv designated process is a violation of this Agreement. Should a Company be found in violation of this Section 3.5, it will owe WeSolv an amount with respect to each instance equal to the greater of (a) US$2,500; or (b) the applicable fees had the payments been processed through the WeSolv process, plus 18%.</p>

					<!-- <p class="font_8">&nbsp;</p> -->

					<p class="font_8">YOU WILL NOTIFY WESOLV IMMEDIATELY IF ANOTHER PERSON IMPROPERLY CONTACTS YOU OR SUGGESTS MAKING OR RECEIVING PAYMENTS OUTSIDE OF THE SITE. If you are aware of a breach or potential breach of this non-circumvention policy, please submit a confidential report to WeSolv by sending an email message to: info@WeSolv.com.</p>
